# PyLink

PyLink is an IRC PseudoService written in Python.

## Dependencies

PyLink is a serious WIP right now (it doesn't even understand the concept of users yet). Dependencies currently include:

* Python 3.4
* PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml` or `apt-get install python3-yaml`)

## Usage

1) Rename `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` and configure your instance there. Of course, most of the options aren't implemented yet!

2) Run `main.py` from the command line.

3) Profit???
