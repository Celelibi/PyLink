PyLink is an IRC PseudoService written in Python.

## Dependencies

PyLink is a serious WIP right now. Dependencies currently include:

* InspIRCd 2.0.x: more protocol modules may be implemented in the future...
* Python 3.4+
* PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml` or `apt-get install python3-yaml`)

## Usage

1) Rename `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` and configure your instance there. Not all options are properly implemented yet, and the configuration schema isn't finalized yet.

2) Run `main.py` from the command line.

3) Profit???
